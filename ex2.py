# EXERCISE 2

# 1. Interpolation search is better than binary search since you are able to find the position of 
#    the target accurately through knowledge of the distribution and size of data. Adding on to that, 
#    interpolation is ideal for uniformly distributed data.


# 2. Since the data is not uniformly distributed, the midpoint calculation may not be accurate, and
#    thus, the search method is not as efficient as it should be. This is because interpolation assumes
#    that there is a common pattern among the data and it will try to predict the position of the target based on this pattern. 
#    If this pattern does not exist, then the calculation of this index will not be correct.
